
# 1. Compile the from Enter build directory
cmake .. --debug-output
make -j4

then from main directory 
you just run this 

# 2. Run the simulation from main directory

mpirun -np 8 ./build/main2d input2d



# Check available memory
free -h

# Run with memory monitoring
mpirun -np 6 /usr/bin/time -v ./build/main2d input2d 2>&1 | grep -E "Maximum resident|Memory"

# Or with reduced resolution (should work)
sed -i 's/^N = 64$/N = 32/' input2d
mpirun -np 4 ./build/main2d input2d  # Should NOT crash
