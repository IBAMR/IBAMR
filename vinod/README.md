## Purpose

This workspace is designed for:
- Developing custom IBAMR simulations
- Testing new features and modifications
- Experimenting with different IB methods
- Creating reusable components and utilities

## Getting Started

1. **Build Prerequisites**: Ensure IBAMR is properly installed with all dependencies
2. **Explore Examples**: Check the `examples/` directory for sample simulations
3. **Review Documentation**: See `docs/` for detailed notes and guides
4. **Run Scripts**: Use utilities in `scripts/` to automate common tasks

## Documentation

- [Examples Guide](docs/EXAMPLES.md) - How to run the example simulations
- [Custom Components](docs/CUSTOM_COMPONENTS.md) - Documentation for custom classes
- [Development Notes](docs/NOTES.md) - Research notes and ideas

## Contributing

This is a personal workspace for custom IBAMR development. Feel free to use these examples and extensions as templates for your own work.

## License

These extensions build upon IBAMR, which is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. Custom code in this directory follows the same license unless otherwise specified.
