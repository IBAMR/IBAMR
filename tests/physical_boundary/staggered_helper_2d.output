Testing masking function
Copied value on index (0,0) and axis 0
Copied value on index (2,0) and axis 0
Copied value on index (0,1) and axis 0
Copied value on index (2,1) and axis 0
Copied value on index (0,2) and axis 1

Testing dirichlet boundaries
Cell (0,0) and axis 0 touches boundary
Cell (2,0) and axis 0 touches boundary
Cell (0,1) and axis 0 touches boundary
Cell (2,1) and axis 0 touches boundary
Cell (0,2) and axis 1 touches boundary
Cell (1,2) and axis 1 touches boundary
