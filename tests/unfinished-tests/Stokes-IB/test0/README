This is a test case for two levels of grid hierarchy (AMR or uniform refinement).

(1) The linearized Stokes-IB equations are solved by the StokesIBSolver class to
test the FAC preconditioner/operator.

(2) Matrix and matrix-free SAJ at the finest level (level 1) can be tested by
choosing a suitable version of the Mat-Vec multiply routine in 
StokesIBSolver::initializeSolver() routine. The FAC op uses matrix version of SAJ. The
Krylov solver should converge in a single iteration (with tight tolerances) for
the uniform refinement case, if StokesIBSolver class uses matrix version of SAJ in doing
matrix-vector multiplication for doing the IB part. The matrix-free version should only take
a couple of iterations to converge. Read more comments in the code for the StokesIBSolver
class description.

(3) SAJ matrix at the coarsest level is obtained by two methods: (a) from PETSc
routine MatPtAP() and from (b) buildSAJCoarsestFromSAMRAIOperators() routine
that uses SAMRAI operators (RT0 types) to prolong and restrict basis vectors.
They should be the same when viewed in MATLAB.
