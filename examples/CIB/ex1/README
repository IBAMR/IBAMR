This is an example of prescribed kinematics for two bodies. The outer shell (structure 0) moves with
a unit translational velocity while the inner sphere (structure 1) is kept at rest. The mobility matrices
of two structures are formed independently and are distributed to different processors (if the case is run
on multiple procssors).
