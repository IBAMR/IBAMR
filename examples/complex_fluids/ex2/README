This example sets up flow past a confined cylinder. The structure is tethered
in place using a penalty method. The structure is represented using a finite
element representation following the IBFEMethod. Drag coefficients are
outputted in text files. An interpolation class is included to interpolate the
stress onto the surface of the cylinder.
