This example simulates the rising bubbles with solidification using phase-field method. Initially the gas phase occupies the region above y=0.75 and the solid phase is at the bottom below y=0.1. In the middle region is liquid phase with three bubble. Solidification happens till all the liquid is converted into solid. While solidification progresses, some bubbles are trapped inside the solid.
