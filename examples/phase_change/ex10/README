Initially, three bubbles are placed in the liquid. Solidification starts due to the boundary condition at the bottom boundary and continues till complete solidification takes place. In between the process, two bubbles are trapped inside the solid while one escapes into the air. Please refer to "A consistent, volume preserving, and adaptive mesh refinement-based framework for modeling non-isothermal gas-liquid-solid flows with phase change" article for more details.
