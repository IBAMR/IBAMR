In this example, Stefan problem is solved with the heat flux boundary condition. There two ways considered: One is imposing the flux boundary condition on the left boundary (input2d_2phase.amr) and the other one imposes this flux boundary condition through the LaserSourceFunction class. Please refer to "A consistent, volume preserving, and adaptive mesh refinement-based framework for modeling non-isothermal gas-liquid-solid flows with phase change" article for more details.
