In this example, 1D penalized Poisson equation is solved to assess the accuracy of flux-based VP method using MMS problem. The MMS problem is given in Section 2.1 of "Volume penalization for inhomogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions modeling scalar flux in complicated geometry" by Sakurai et al. The only modification is the computational domain which varies from -pi to 2pi instead of 0 to 2pi. The flux-forcing function is constructed analytically.
