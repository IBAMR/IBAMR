A test program to demonstrate static equilibrium of a stationary cylinder on an air-water interface
and the differences between the "full" and "flow" gravitational forces.

The file cylinder2d.vertex (which is required for the 2D example) is generated by cylinderGen.cpp. This file is automatically generated by the build process.
