This directory contains several helpful scripts to validate and update IB input files.

beam_viewer3d.m, spring_viewer3d.m, target_viewer3d.m, vertex_viewer3d.m:
  -- These contain Matlab functions to plot 3D beam, spring, target and vertex files.

beam_validator3d.pl, spring_validator3d.pl, target_point_validator3d.pl
  -- These are Perl scripts that determine whether beam, spring, or target files are valid.
  -- Note that these check that initial resting lengths/beam curvatures are consistent with the initial specifications.
  -- These will generate a large number of warnings if the above is not true.

set_spring_rest_length.pl set_spring_stiffness.pl
  -- These are Perl scripts that will edit spring input files to change the stiffness and resting lengths.

scale_spring_stiffness.pl, scale_spring_rest_length.pl
  -- These are Perl scripts that will edit spring input files to scale the stiffness and resting lengths.
