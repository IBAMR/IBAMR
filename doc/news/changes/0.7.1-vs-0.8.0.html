<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: IBAMR now requires the initialization object IBTKInit to be created upon
program start. IBTKInit is responsible for initializing and deinitializing all
libraries as well as registering the MPI communicator with IBTK_MPI. All
SAMRAI_MPI calls in the library have been replaced with respective IBTK_MPI
calls. The perl script scripts/code_updates/update_mpi_calls.pl will
automatically complete most of the changes.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2020/04/25)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBTK::get_local_active_element_bounding_boxes() and related functions
have been renamed to IBTK::get_local_element_bounding_boxes() (i.e., without the
active part). This change is necessary since the current version of the function
does not work correctly when AMR is used inside libMesh - switching to computing
all bounding boxes resolves the issue.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/06/25)
</li>
<li>
Removed: The IB6 delta function, <code>lagrangian_ib_6_delta</code>, has been
removed from the library. This does not effect the IB6 spreading and
interpolation functions since they directly inline the kernel: i.e., the IB6
delta function can still be used in the same way as before through the normal
interface.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/27)
</li>
<li>
Removed: The classes IBTK::JacobianCalculator and IBTK::JacobianCalculatorCache
have been removed. Their replacements are IBTK::Mapping and IBTK::MappingCache,
respectively, which can compute many more finite element mapping quantities than
JacobianCalculator could.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/28)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBTK::Mapping, IBTK::NodalMapping, and IBTK::MappingCache have been
renamed to IBTK::FEMapping, IBTK::FENodalMapping, and IBTK::FEMappingCache
respectively.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/08/03)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBTK::FEData::SystemDofMapCache::dof_indices() now returns a
<code>boost::multi_array</code> instead of nested <code>std::vector</code>s.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/08/13)
</li>
<li>
Removed: The class IBTK::FEMapCache has been removed.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/01)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBTK::FEData now requires that the relevant libMesh::EquationSystems
object be passed to its constructor.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/10)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The overloads of IBTK::FEDataManager::getManager() have been
consolidated into a single function.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/10)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBAMR no longer links against the high-level HDF5 (hdf5_hl) library. If you
need to use this library you will need to add it to the link interface manually.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/16)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The functions IBTK::FEDataManager::setPatchLevels(),
IBTK::FEDataManager::getPatchLevels(), and IBTK::FEDataManager::getLevelNumber()
have been removed. The first function was previously never used since the class
assumed the structure interacted with the finest patch level. The other two
functions have been replaced by
IBTK::FEDataManager::getCoarsestPatchLevelNumber() and
IBTK::FEDataManager::getFinestPatchLevelNumber().
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/17)
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Added a new class IBTK::FEValues, which is a replacement for libMesh::FE
for Lagrange elements that is 4-5 times faster. This is now used inside various
parts of the IBFE stack and makes, in particular, assembling the interior force
density much less expensive. For some models this leads to a 10% overall run
time reduction.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/05/19)
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: IBAMR now correctly handles constraints (such as hanging node or
periodicity) inside libMesh correctly when doing IB calculations. In particular,
libMesh structures that have periodic boundary conditions now work correctly in
parallel (such as IBFE example 1). See the documentation of the new function
IBTK::apply_transposed_constraint_matrix() for more information.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/01)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBTK::FEProjector now uses a much better algorithm for solving L2
projections (Jacobi preconditioner based on the lumped mass matrix and MINRES)
which is about twice as fast for large tetrahedral meshes.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/23)
</li>
<li>
New: Added a new class IBAMR::FEMechanicsExplicitIntegrator that provides a
basic explicit FE elastodynamics solver.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2020/08/25)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR::IBFEMethod gained a new member variable d_patch_assocation_cfl
which determines how often (independent of regrids) the association of elements
to patches must be rebuilt.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/08/25)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR::FEMechanicsBase is able to compute static pressures for
mesh parts to enforce near incompressibility.
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, 2020/09/11)
</li>
<li>
New: IBAMR::IBFEMethod can now be set up to have a single structure interact
with multiple patch levels.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/28)
</li>
<li>
New: IBAMR can now be configured, compiled, and installed with CMake instead of
with autotools.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/10/19)
</li>
<li>
New: Added a new class IBTK::FischerGuess, which implements an algorithm for
estimating a solution to a linear system of equations based on a RHS and a
history of solution vectors and RHSs. This is now on by default in IBFE. A
benchmark based on IBFE/ex4 requires 75% fewer solver iterations with this class
and its default settings.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/11/24)
</li>
<li>
New: Added a new classes BrinkmanAdvDiffSemiImplicitHierarchyIntegrator and BrinkmanAdvDiffBcHelper. Class BrinkmanAdvDiffSemiImplicitHierarchyIntegrator solves a penalized advection-diffusion equation for the registered scalar and vector-valued quantities. The BrinkmanAdvDiffBcHelper provides an implementation of a volume penalized body force and linear operator modifications required to impose Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions  to scalar and vector quantities maintained by BrinkmanSemiImplicitAdvDiffHierarchyIntegrator.
<br>
(Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy, 2020/12/18)
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Bug fix: AdvDiffHierarchyIntegrator correctly computes maximum timesteps consistent across all timesteps.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, 2020/06/26)
</li>
<li>
Fix: GCC 10.1.0 generates incorrect vectorized code for the multi-variable
overload of IBTK::get_values_for_interpolation(). Get around this by adding
a temporary array to the function.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/06/29)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The database option <code>vector_assembly_accumulation</code> has been
removed from IBFEMethod since the <code>CACHED</code> option (which is not the
default) does not work correctly when the finite element space has constraints,
while the default option <code>GHOSTED</code> has superior performance and works
correctly with or without constraints.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/14)
</li>
<li>
New: Added a new field IBTK::FEDataManager::WorkloadSpec::duplicated_node_weight
which allows for accounting for the number of elements (in an indirect way) when
doing IB load balancing.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/24)
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: AppInitializer now creates the TimerManager correctly using the
database provided from the input file.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, 2020/06/26)
</li>
<li>
Improved: The bounding box intersection algorithm for associating libMesh
elements with patches has been rewritten to be about 9 times faster. This
substantially lowers the time required in regrid operations.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/31)
</li>
<li>
New: IBFEMethod now logs its time spent in various functions with the standard
SAMRAI TimerManager interface.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/08/06)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBTK::FEDataManager now executes a check that, after associating
patches with elements, that all mesh nodes are assigned to at least one patch.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/06/29)
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: CFINSForcing::getVariableIdx() now returns the correct patch data index that stores the extra stress.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, 2020/09/01)

</li>
<li>
Fixed: The configuration option <code>--with-zlib</code> now works correctly.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/09/10)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Added a functionality to handle variable C coefficient in CCPoissonPointRelaxationFACOperator class.
    <br>
    (Ramakrishnan Thirumalaisamy, 2020/10/08)
</li>
<li>
Fix: The internal PatchHierarchy optionally created by IBFEMethod (i.e., the
scratch hierarchy) is now correctly deallocated during regridding.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/10/16)
</li>
<li>
New: IBAMR::IBHierarchyIntegrator gained an input database option
<code>regrid_structure_cfl_interval</code> that allows the user to set the
number of cells the structure may move before triggering a regrid.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/10/27)
</li>
<li>
Documentation update: Adds in notes for interacting with Lagrangian data controlled by LDataManager.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, 2020/12/07)
</li>
<li>
New: Added in functions to check relative and absolute equality between doubles.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, 2020/12/08)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: RT0_COARSEN now corresponds to the adjoint of RT0_REFINE on uniformly refined grid hierarchies.
<br>
(Aaron Barret, Boyce Griffith, David Wells 2020/12/15)
</li>
<li>
Fix: Fixed a problem with IBFEMethod when the ghost data size required by
IBFEMethod is not equal to that required by another class.
<br>
(David Wells, 2020/07/13)
</li>
<li>
New: Input settings to control whether libMesh is allowed to use negative quadrature weights.
(The libMesh default is to allow for negative weights, which is currently also the IBAMR default.)
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, David Wells 2021/01/05)

</li>
<li>
Changed: Diagonal (lumped) mass matrices are constructed using nodal quadrature
rules (the midpoint rule for constants, QTRAP for linears, and QSIMPSON for
quadratics).
<br>
(Boyce Griffith, David Wells, 2021/01/06)
