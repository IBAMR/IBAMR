<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Changed: Standardized the spelling of null space.

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
New: Added a class that can compute averages of noise fields over several periods.
<br>

</li>
</ol>

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Fixed: Fixed upper convected derivative in cases of non divergence-free velocity fields.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2025/04/24)
</li>
<li>
Fix: Updated the IIM velocity-interpolation scheme to the version proposed by Tan et al. in “An Immersed Interface Method for the Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations with Discontinuous Viscosity Across the Interface.”
(Qi Sun, 2025/06/09)</li>
<li>
Improved: The CMake configuration now exports basic information about our
external dependencies.
<br>
(David Wells, 2025/07/21)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: The H5Part marker point output now saves the marker ids.
<br>
(David Wells, 2025/08/11)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Fixed the ability of IBExplicitHierarchyIntegrator to restart any marker
points it owns.
<br>
(Marshall Davey, 2025/08/14)
</li>
<li>
Fixed: Fluid sources and sinks are now computed before regridding. This fixes a
bug where sources were not set, which caused arbitrary values to be added to the
divergence, which in turn caused arbitrary values in the velocity field.

Furthermore, IBFEMethod now assumes that sources may be computed at any point
in a timestep (or outside of a timestep).
<br>
(David Wells, 2025/08/28)
</li>
<li>
New: More composite B-spline kernels.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2025/05/218)
</li>
<li>
New: Added interpolation functions to easily interpolate Eulerian data to specified positions.
<br>
