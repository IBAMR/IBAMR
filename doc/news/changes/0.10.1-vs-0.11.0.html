<h2>Incompatibilities</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Changed: IBRedundantInitializer now allows for passing object states to
functions via optional void* parameters.
<br> (Aaron Barrett, 2022/04/26)
</li>
<li>
Changed: The return type of FESurfaceDistanceEvaluator::getNeighborIntersectionsMap()
has changed to use <tt>const libMesh::Elem*</tt> values to fix a compatibility issue
with upcoming versions of libMesh.
<br>

<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Improved: A new example, ex7, has been added to the directory <path to IBAMR>/examples/IB/explicit/. ex7 demonstrates how to track and print the Eulerian coordinates of IB points over the course of a simulation. More details can be found at <path to IBAMR>/examples/IB/explicit/ex7/README.md.
<br>

</li>
<li>
New: Added eight new tutorial programs which demonstrate various uses of
IIMethod and its extension to ILE.

<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR::IBMethod and IBAMR::IMPMethod now check (via IBTK::LDataManager)
that all points are, accounting for periodicity, within the computational domain
during initialization.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/01/21)
</li>
<li>
New: Two new examples added to IBLevelSet/examples directory. The ex4 simulates the self propelling motion of a single pitching airfoil. The ex5 simulates the self propelling motion of two pitching airfoils.
<br>
(Kaustubh Khedkar and Amneet Bhalla, 2022/02/08)
</li>
<li>
New: Added a class that can store snapshots of data during a simulation. This can be used to, among other things, compute statistics of a (periodic) steady state flow field.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2022/02/18)
</li>
<li>
Changed: IBAMR's CMake build system now lets HDF5 resolve the zlib dependency.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/02/21)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR::IBRedundantInitializer (and, through it, IBAMR::IBMethod) now
works with points initially placed on top physical boundaries. Previously points
could only be placed on boundaries which happened to be the lower ones.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/03/07)
</li>
<li>
Improved: The advection diffusion integrator now outputs visualization files
correctly based on the depth of the advected variable.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2022/03/08)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBAMR::FEMechanicsBase and IBAMR::IBFEMethod now print an error message if
any of the elements in the provided mesh are inverted.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/04/11)
</li>
<li>
Improved: IBTK::FEProjector now uses the conjugate gradient method instead of
MINRES. This switch lowers finite element solver time by about 50% in 3D.
<br>
(David Wells, 2022/04/28)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Multiple advection diffusion integrators can be registered with the
navier stokes integrator.
<br>
(Aaron Barrett, 2022/05/26)
</li>
<li>
Improved: Can now set how ghost cells are filled in the Stokes operators. A
consistent discrete Laplacian requires "QUADRATIC" interpolation at the
boundaries. The default behavior for IBAMR is to use "LINEAR" interpolation.
