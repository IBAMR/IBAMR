Changed: The database option <code>vector_assembly_accumulation</code> has been
removed from IBFEMethod since the <code>CACHED</code> option (which is not the
default) does not work correctly when the finite element space has constraints,
while the default option <code>GHOSTED</code> has superior performance and works
correctly with or without constraints.
