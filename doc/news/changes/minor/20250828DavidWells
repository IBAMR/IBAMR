Fixed: Fluid sources and sinks are now computed before regridding. This fixes a
bug where sources were not set, which caused arbitrary values to be added to the
divergence, which in turn caused arbitrary values in the velocity field.

Furthermore, IBFEMethod now assumes that sources may be computed at any point
in a timestep (or outside of a timestep).
