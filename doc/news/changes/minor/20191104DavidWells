Fixed: IBFEMethod::resetHierarchyConfiguration() now sets the starting patch
level on its FEDataManager objects to the finest level number instead of 0.
This fixes a bug where an FEDataManager could have its coarsest level set to
something other than its finest level (supporting multiple grid levels is
presently not supported).
