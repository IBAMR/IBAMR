New: IBFEMethod can now partition data internally based on the number of IB
(i.e., quadrature) points used in spreading and velocity interpolation. This
feature greatly improves parallel scalability of this class since, in general,
the number of IB points on a processor is only weakly correlated with the number
of cells on that processor.
