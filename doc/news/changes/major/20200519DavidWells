New: Added a new class IBTK::FEValues, which is a replacement for libMesh::FE
for Lagrange elements that is 4-5 times faster. This is now used inside various
parts of the IBFE stack and makes, in particular, assembling the interior force
density much less expensive. For some models this leads to a 10% overall run
time reduction.
