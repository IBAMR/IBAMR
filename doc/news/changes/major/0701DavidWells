Bug fix: IBAMR now correctly handles constraints (such as hanging node or
periodicity) inside libMesh correctly when doing IB calculations. In particular,
libMesh structures that have periodic boundary conditions now work correctly in
parallel (such as IBFE example 1). See the documentation of the new function
IBTK::apply_transposed_constraint_matrix() for more information.
