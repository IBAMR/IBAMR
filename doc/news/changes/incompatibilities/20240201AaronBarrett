Changed: The complex fluid solver has been revamped to allow for more flexible
specifications of fluid models. The class CFRelaxationOperator has been
replaced with CFStrategy, in which users can specify both a relaxation function
and a conformation-to-stress conversion function. Additional solver options
have also been added to CFUpperConvectiveOperator.
