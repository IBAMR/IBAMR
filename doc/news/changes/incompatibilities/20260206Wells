Changed: IBAMR no longer stores redundant component output: e.g., for
INSStaggeredHierarchyIntegrator, the output velocity is stored by just U and not
also U_x, U_y, and U_z. If you needed to access these values outside of VisIt
or ParaView for data-processing purposes, then use, e.g., the path
<tt>/processor.00000/level.00001/patch.00016/U.01</tt>
instead of
<tt>/processor.00000/level.00001/patch.00016/U_x</tt>
to retrieve component output.
