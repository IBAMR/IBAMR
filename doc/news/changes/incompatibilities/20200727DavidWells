Removed: The IB6 delta function, <code>lagrangian_ib_6_delta</code>, has been
removed from the library. This does not effect the IB6 spreading and
interpolation functions since they directly inline the kernel: i.e., the IB6
delta function can still be used in the same way as before through the normal
interface.
