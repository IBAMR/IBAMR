New: IBAMR now requires the initialization object IBTKInit to be created upon
program start. IBTKInit is responsible for initializing and deinitializing all
libraries as well as registering the MPI communicator with IBTK_MPI. All
SAMRAI_MPI calls in the library have been replaced with respective IBTK_MPI
calls. The perl script scripts/code_updates/update_mpi_calls.pl will
automatically complete most of the changes.
