Changed: The functions IBTK::FEDataManager::setPatchLevels(),
IBTK::FEDataManager::getPatchLevels(), and IBTK::FEDataManager::getLevelNumber()
have been removed. The first function was previously never used since the class
assumed the structure interacted with the finest patch level. The other two
functions have been replaced by
IBTK::FEDataManager::getCoarsestPatchLevelNumber() and
IBTK::FEDataManager::getFinestPatchLevelNumber().
