Changed: IBTK::FECache has been changed in several incompatible ways to enable
compatibility with elements that are not translation invariant (e.g., libMesh's
subdivision elements). In particular, IBTK::FECache will now reinitialize
libMesh::FEBase objects based on a provided set of flags and known properties of
the finite element space before returning the object to the caller. The interface
changes are
<ol>
  <li>IBTK::FECache objects must be set up with an enum (IBTK::FEUpdateFlags)
  describing which values should be computed on each element.</li>
  <li>IBTK::FECache::operator[]() has been replaced by
  IBTK::FECache::operator()(), which takes a libMesh::Elem pointer as an
  argument which is used to reinitialize values and gradients when
  appropriate.</li>
</ol>
