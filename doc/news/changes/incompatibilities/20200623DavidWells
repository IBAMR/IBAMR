Changed: IBTK::get_local_active_element_bounding_boxes() and related functions
have been renamed to IBTK::get_local_element_bounding_boxes() (i.e., without the
active part). This change is necessary since the current version of the function
does not work correctly when AMR is used inside libMesh - switching to computing
all bounding boxes resolves the issue.
