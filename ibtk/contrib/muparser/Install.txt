 Installation
 ============

 muParser can be installed just extracting the sources somewhere
 and then, from a terminal, typing:

   cd [path to muParser]
   cmake . [-DENABLE_SAMPLES=ON/OFF] [-DENABLE_OPENMP=OFF/ON] [-DENABLE_WIDE_CHAR=OFF/ON]
           [-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON/OFF]
   make
   [sudo*] make install
   [sudo*] ldconfig
   cd samples/example1
   ./example1

 * = this command must be executed with root permissions and thus
     you have to use 'sudo' or just 'su' to gain root access.
     Note that installation and ldconfig are not strictly required unless
     you built in shared mode.

 The "make" step will create the muParser library in 'lib' and the
 sample binary in samples/example1.
 The samples/example2 is win32-specific and thus won't be built.



 Other miscellaneous info Unix-specific
 ======================================

 If you don't like to have your muParser folder filled by temporary
 files created by GCC, then you can do the following:

    mkdir mybuild && cd mybuild && cmake .. && make

 to put all object files in the "mybuild" directory.

 If you want to use muParser library in your programs, you can use
 the pkg-config program (this works only if muParser was installed
 with 'make install' !). The commands:

   pkg-config muparser --cflags
   pkg-config muparser --libs

 will return all useful info you need to build your programs against
 muParser !
