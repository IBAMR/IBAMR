/*!
 * \brief Class BJacobiPreconditioner is a block Jacobi preconditioner which
 * implements the abstract LinearSolver interface.
 *
 * This solver class performs a single block Jacobi sweep, applying specified
 * component LinearSolver objects to the components of a supplied
 * SAMRAI::solv::SAMRAIVectorReal vector, and doing so in an additive fashion.
 * Note that the block Jacobi algorithm is not generally convergent, but can be
 * used as a preconditioner for a KrylovLinearSolver.
 *
 * \note Class BGaussSeidelPreconditioner implements the multiplicative (i.e.,
 * block Gauss-Seidel) version of this algorithm.
 *
 * Sample parameters for initialization from database (and their default
 * values): \verbatim

 initial_guess_nonzero = FALSE      // see setInitialGuessNonzero()
 rel_residual_tol = 1.0e-6          // see setRelativeTolerance()
 abs_residual_tol = 1.0e-30         // see setAbsoluteTolerance()
 max_iterations = 1                 // see setMaxIterations()

     * Before calling solveSystem(), the form of the solution \a x and

     * patch interiors on the specified range of levels in the patch hierarchy.
     * The user is responsible for all data management for the quantities
     * associated with the solution and right-hand-side vectors.  In particular,
     * patch data in these vectors must be allocated prior to calling this
     * method.
     *
     * \param x solution vector
     * \param b right-hand-side vector
     *
     * <b>Conditions on Parameters:</b>
     * - vectors \a x and \a b must have same patch hierarchy
     * - vectors \a x and \a b must have same structure, depth, etc.
     *
     * \note The vector arguments for solveSystem() need not match those for
     * initializeSolverState().  However, there must be a certain degree of
     * similarity, including:\par
     * - hierarchy configuration (hierarchy pointer and range of levels)
     * - number, type and alignment of vector component data
     * - ghost cell widths of data in the solution \a x and right-hand-side \a b

     * solves.

     * \brief Compute hierarchy dependent data required for solving \f$Ax=b\f$.

     * efficient to:
