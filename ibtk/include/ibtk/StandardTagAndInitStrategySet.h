/*!
 * \brief Class StandardTagAndInitStrategySet is a utility class that allows
 * multiple SAMRAI::mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy objects to be employed by a
 * single SAMRAI::mesh::StandardTagAndInitialize object.
 *
 * This class is primarily intended to provide a mechanism for allowing
 * user-define tagging criteria.
 *
 * \note When the return value of a method is a timestep size, class
 * StandardTagAndInitStrategySet returns the \em minimum timestep size computed
 * by the collection of concrete SAMRAI::mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy
 * objects.  Consequently, user-defined tagging classes \em must provide
 * implementations of getLevelDt() and advanceLevel() which return a large value
 * such as \a MAX_DOUBLE as the timestep size.
 *
 * \warning Not all concrete implementations of class
 * SAMRAI::mesh::StandardTagAndInitStrategy will work properly with class
 * StandardTagAndInitStrategySet.

     * Advance data on all patches on specified patch level from current time
     * (current_time) to new time (new_time).  This routine is called only
     * during time-dependent regridding procedures, such as Richardson
     * extrapolation.  It is virtual with an empty implementation here (rather
     * than pure virtual) so that users are not required to provide an
     * implementation when the function is not needed.  The boolean arguments
     * are used to determine the state of the algorithm and the data when the
     * advance routine is called.  Note that this advance function is also used
     * during normal time integration steps.
     *
     * When this function is called, the level data required to begin the
     * advance must be allocated and be defined appropriately.  Typically, this
     * is equivalent to what is needed to initialize a new level after
     * regridding.  Upon exiting this routine, both current and new data may
     * exist on the level.  This data is needed until level synchronization
     * occurs, in general.  Current and new data may be reset by calling the
     * member function resetTimeDependentData().
     *
     * This routine is called from two different points within the Richardson
     * extrapolation process: to advance a temporary level that is coarser than
     * the hierarchy level on which error estimation is performed, and to
     * advance the hierarchy level itself.  In the first case, the values of the
     * boolean flags are:
     *


     *    - \b  first_step
     *        = true.
     *    - \b  last_step
     *        = true.
     *    - \b  regrid_advance
     *        = true.
     *


     * In the second case, the values of the boolean flags are:
     *


     *    - \b  first_step
     *      (when regridding during time integration sequence)
     *        = true when the level is not coarsest level to synchronize
     *          immediately before the regridding process; else, false.
     *      (when generating initial hierarchy construction)
     *        = true, even though there may be multiple advance steps.
     *    - \b  last_step
     *        = true when the advance is the last in the Richardson
     *          extrapolation step sequence; else false.
     *    - \b  regrid_advance
     *        = true.
