/*!
 * \brief Class VCSCViscousOperator is a subclass of SCLaplaceOperator
 * which implements a globally second-order accurate side-centered finite
 * difference discretization of a vector elliptic operator of the form
 * \f$ L = \beta C I + \alpha \nabla \cdot \mu ( (\nabla u) + (\nabla u)^T ) \f$.
 *
 * Here \f$ u \f$ and \f$ C \f$ are vector valued side-centered fields and
 * \f$ \mu \f$ is a node-(2D) or edge-(3D) centered scalar field.
 *
 * The scaling factors of \f$ C \f$ and \f$ \mu \f$ variables are passed separately
 * and are denoted by \f$ \beta \f$ and \f$ \alpha \f$, respectively.

     *
     * Before calling this function, the form of the vectors x and y should be
     * set properly by the user on all patch interiors on the range of levels
     * covered by the operator.  All data in these vectors should be allocated.
     * Thus, the user is responsible for managing the storage for the vectors.
     *
     * Conditions on arguments:
     * - vectors must have same hierarchy
     * - vectors must have same variables (except that x \em must
     * have enough ghost cells for computation of Ax).
     *
     * \note In general, the vectors x and y \em cannot be the same.
     *
     * Upon return from this function, the y vector will contain the result of
     * the application of A to x.
     *
     * initializeOperatorState must be called prior to any calls to
     * applyOperator.
