     * \brief Compute hierarchy dependent data required for solving

     *
     * In a typical implementation, the solveSystem() method will compute some
     * required hierarchy dependent data before the solve, and then remove that
     * data after the solve.  For multiple solves that use the same hierarchy
     * configuration, it is more efficient to:

     * -# initialize the hierarchy-dependent data required by the solver via
     *    initializeSolverState(),
     * -# solve the system one or more times via solveSystem(), and
     * -# remove the hierarchy-dependent data via deallocateSolverState().
     *
     * Note that it is generally necessary to reinitialize the solver state when
     * the hierarchy configuration changes.
