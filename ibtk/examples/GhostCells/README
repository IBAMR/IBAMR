This example program demonstrates how to fill in ghost cells, both by using the
IBAMR provided HierarchyGhostCellInterpolation and by creating a new SAMRAI
CoarsenOperator and RefineOperator. Note that this example does not treat
physical boundary conditions.

In this example, we assume we have a cell centered variable that represents the
total amount of stuff inside a cell. We wish to linearly interpolate this
variable to the cell nodes. To do this, we must first fill in a layer of ghost
cells in the AMR grid so we have enough data for our stencil. Typical
applications in IBAMR and SAMRAI involve computing a concentration of stuff
inside a cell, and hence the pre-written ghost filling operations must act on
the concentration of stuff, not the total amount of stuff. We will show two
different ways to proceed. First, we could compute the total amount of stuff to
a concentration, then use IBAMR and SAMRAI's ghost filling operations, then
finally convert back to total amount of stuff. Alternatively, we could write a
new CoarsenOperator and RefineOperator to fill in ghost cells directly.
